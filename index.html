            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by!
            If you don't already know me, my name is Hector.
            I am a scientist by trade and many other things not by trade.
            My areas of interest are in virtual reality and spatial computing, with a specific interest in identity, bodies/embodiment, and action capabilities.</p>
            I'm currently applying for PhD's, if you ended up here through one of the links in my application materials, please let me in to your program! Thank you!</p>
